# Potto

Alternative deployment for [loris IIF image server](https://github.com/loris-imageserver/loris),
designed to run in [Amazon Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) 
and serve images stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

The Loris `setup.py` is more like an application installer rather than something that should be run by `pip`.  (It wants specific users on the system to exist, for example.).

To deploy to a beanstalk python app server, this uses `git` to grab the `#development` branch of the offical Loris, and then it subclasses (to override configuration style and to provide an S3 resolver) and monkey patches (to provide a stub for a healh check URL) loris.  `./deploy-version.sh` creates a `.zip` file of the application and deploys it to a beanstalk environment.

## Configuration

See [Configuring Python Containers with Elastic Beanstalk](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-container.html)

Set these in the environment.

`SOURCE_ROOT` s3:// URL to s3 bucket and prefix where jp2s are stored

`SOURCE_REGION` region in Amazon (you should usually run in the same
region as the bucket)

## deploy script

`./deploy-version.sh` will need to be customized to your app (setting correct application etc.).
